The regression analysis examined the relationship between work-life balance and loneliness in a
sample of 15,646 participants. A linear regression analysis showed that poorer work–life balance was associated with higher loneliness. 
The model was statistically significant, F(1, 15644) = 522, p < .001, explaining 3.2% of the variance in loneliness (R² = .03). Poorer work–life balance significantly predicted higher loneliness (β = −0.04, SE = 0.002, t = −22.85, p < .001).
The model explains only around 3.2% of the variance in loneliness, suggesting that while better work-life balance is linked to slightly lower loneliness, many other factors also contribute. Overall, the findings highlight a meaningful yet modest inverse relationship between work-life balance and feelings of loneliness.
