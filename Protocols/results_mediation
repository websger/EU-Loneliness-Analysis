A causal mediation analysis was conducted to test whether the mediator accounted for the association between work–life balance and loneliness. The indirect effect (ACME) was small and not statistically significant, p = .076. The direct effect remained significant (ADE = 0.028, 95% CI [0.012, 0.045], p < .001). The total effect was also significant (Total Effect = 0.027, 95% CI [0.011, 0.044], p < .001). The proportion mediated was not significant, p = .076. 
The mediation analysis shows that the mediator relationship-need (relationship_need_num) has almost no eﬀect on the relationship between gender (gender_num) and loneliness (loneliness_total). The ACME (indirect eﬀect) is very small and not statistically significant (p = 0.076), indicating that the pathway through the mediator is negligible.
The total eﬀect is significant, but it is almost entirely driven by the direct eﬀect. Only a very small, non-significant proportion of the eﬀect is mediated. As the ADE is positive women in our sample show higher scores on loneliness.
In total all effects, even the statistically significant ones, are rather small.
