Conclusions and Limitations

The present study examined two complementary pathways related to loneliness: (1) a mediation model in which gender differences in relationship-need were hypothesized to explain gender differences in loneliness, and (2) a regression model testing whether poorer work–life balance predicts higher loneliness. Together, these analyses provide a differentiated picture of how interpersonal and structural factors shape loneliness.
Consistent with previous literature, loneliness was associated with poorer work–life balance. Participants with lower work-life balance might experience a role overload that emphasize the strain created when work and family demands exceed personal resources (Chuang et al., 2024; Fostervold et al., 2024). The effect size was small but robust, suggesting that work–life balance represents as just a small contributor to loneliness. This finding supports the idea that loneliness is not solely an interpersonal problem but a multifaceted one influenced by structural and occupational pressures. 
In contrast, the mediation model did not support the assumption that gender differences in relationship-need explain gender differences in loneliness. Although prior research indicates that women tend to report higher relationship-needs (Caldwell & Peplau, 1982; Fehr, 2011) and higher loneliness across the lifespan (Nicolaisen & Thorsen, 2024; Hernández-Díaz et al., 2025), the indirect effect was not statistically significant. There results suggest that the theorized mechanism of women’s alleged higher relationship-need contributing to higher loneliness may be overly simplistic or incomplete.
One explanation is that gender differences in loneliness are driven less by relationship-need and more by sociocultural norms around emotional expression. Prior studies indicate that men often underreport loneliness due to stigma, emotional norms, and socialization toward self-reliance (Borys & Perlman, 1985; Lau & Gruen, 1992; Barretto et al., 2021). Such reporting biases can attenuate observed gender differences and suppress mediation effects. Additionally, gendered friendship styles may play a role: women’s face-to-face, emotionally expressive friendships (Hays, 1984) may buffer loneliness even when relationship-needs are high, as opposed to men’s side-by-side friendships.
Taken together, the findings point to two key insights. First, work-life balance exerts a direct and consistent influence on loneliness, underscoring the importance of organizational and societal structures in shaping social well-being. Second, gender differences in loneliness appear to be more complex than a simple need-based explanation and likely involve emotional norms, stigma, and interaction styles that extend beyond the scope of relationship-need alone.
This study is limited by its cross-sectional design, which prevents causal inference. All variables were self-reported, making the results vulnerable to reporting biases, especially potential underreporting of loneliness among men. The mediation model relied on a simplified measure of relationship-need that may not capture its full conceptual complexity. Finally, work–life balance and loneliness were measured with limited item breadth, which may have constrained effect sizes.
