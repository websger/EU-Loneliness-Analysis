Loneliness is defined as the perceived gap between desired and actual social connections. 
Research indicates that women report higher relationship needs than men (Caldwell & Peplau, 1982; Fehr, 2011), which may partially explain observed gender differences in loneliness. 
Empirical studies show that women tend to report higher loneliness across the lifespan (Nicolaisen & Thorsen, 2024; Hernández-Díaz, Navarro-Vásquez, Aguilar-Latorre, Méndez-López, Gascón-Santos, & Magallón-Botaya, 2025), whereas men may experience loneliness but are often less willing to disclose it due to social stigma (Borys & Perlman, 1985; Lau & Gruen, 1992; Barretto et al., 2021). Friendship styles differ between genders: women typically engage in face-to-face, emotionally intimate interactions, which protect against loneliness, while men often prefer side-by-side activities that involve less emotional sharing (Caldwell & Peplau, 1982; Hays, 1984). 
These differences suggest that women’s higher relationship need could mediate the association between gender and loneliness. The present study tests this mediation model empirically, with gender as the independent variable, relationship need as the mediator, and loneliness as the dependent variable.

Work-life-Balance influences loneliness through psychological strain caused by role overload, where work and family demands exceed personal resources (Chuang, Chiang, & Lin, 2024; Fostervold, Ulleberg, Nilsen, & Halberg, 2024). Poor WLB increases work-family conflict and role overload, which in turn elevate feelings of loneliness. This study tests the association using a linear regression model, with Work-Life-Balance predicting loneliness.
